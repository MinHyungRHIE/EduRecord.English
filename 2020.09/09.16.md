## 
 - I would have to agree that confidence is the most important. I have some Korean friends that I know have pretty good English, but will only text or send emails in English, but would rather stay quiet or use Korean when speaking because they're too shy about their pronunciation. Sometimes their grammar is a bit off too. But to be honest, anyone who's interested in languages will appreciate the fact you're learning and find it to be absolutely amazing! Even if their grammar or pronunciation isn't always correct, I admire their efforts so much and view them as really diligent people. And as a side thing, I find accents when speaking to be so so cute. So please, don't feel stressed about practicing English, and good luck with your studies!!
