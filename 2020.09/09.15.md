 - exploit(v) exploitation
   - utilize, use, make use of, take advantage of
   - the exploits of brave knights [== accomplishment, feat]

<pre>
if they don't pay any attention and they keep doing the same damn things over and over
and they're not going anywhere and it's painful.
then maybe the proper thing to do is say "you just have your misery"
and so it's acceptable and desirable to try to surround yourself, with people
who are facilitating your development

Never mind. 
No no no, I wanna go. It's just, there's a huge emergency I have to deal with first.
Oh no, is everything okay?
It's about my food truck. I have to get a parking spot.
Oh, that doesn't sound as intense as you were making it out to be 
What is happening?
We have to get there by seven o'clock when they lift the parking restrictions
It's the best spot in Brooklyn and everyone wants it.
Get the hell out of the way!
Charles, I highly doubt the entire food truck industry is racing to get into this one spot, it's not Mad Max
We're neck and neck with rice pudding
we got Korean Tacos on your six
Oh my God, it's real. We're on the Fury Road
Witness me, Blood Bag!
Hold on tight!
